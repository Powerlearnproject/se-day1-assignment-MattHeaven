# Software Engineering and AI Basics

## Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

### 1. What is Software Engineering?
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to design, develop, test, and maintain software. It ensures software is reliable, scalable, and efficient.

**Importance:**  
It drives innovation, underpins modern technologies, and supports industries by delivering high-quality, maintainable solutions.

---

### 2. Key Milestones in Software Engineering Evolution:
- **1940s-50s:** Development of early programming languages (e.g., Fortran, COBOL).  
- **1970s:** Introduction of structured programming to improve code organization.  
- **2000s:** Emergence of Agile methodologies for iterative and collaborative development.

---

### 3. Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
1. **Requirement Analysis:** Understanding what the software should do.  
2. **Design:** Planning architecture and user interfaces.  
3. **Implementation:** Writing and testing code.  
4. **Testing:** Verifying functionality and performance.  
5. **Deployment:** Delivering the software to users.  
6. **Maintenance:** Updating and fixing issues post-launch.

---

### 4. Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies:
- **Waterfall:** Sequential, rigid, suited for projects with clear, fixed requirements (e.g., building banking systems).  
- **Agile:** Iterative, flexible, suitable for dynamic projects requiring continuous feedback (e.g., app development).

---

### 5. Team Roles and Responsibilities:
- **Software Developer:** Writes and maintains code, implements features.  
- **Quality Assurance Engineer:** Tests software, ensures it meets quality standards.  
- **Project Manager:** Coordinates team efforts, manages timelines, and ensures project goals are met.

---

### 6. Importance of IDEs and VCS:
- **IDEs (e.g., Visual Studio, IntelliJ):** Simplify coding with tools like debugging and syntax highlighting.  
- **VCS (e.g., Git):** Tracks changes, facilitates collaboration, and prevents data loss.

---

### 7. Common Challenges in Software Engineering:
- **Challenge:** Keeping up with evolving technologies.  
  **Strategy:** Continuous learning and training.  
- **Challenge:** Handling tight deadlines.  
  **Strategy:** Effective planning and prioritization.  

---

### 8. Types of Testing:
- **Unit Testing:** Tests individual components.  
- **Integration Testing:** Ensures modules work together.  
- **System Testing:** Verifies the entire applicationâ€™s functionality.  
- **Acceptance Testing:** Confirms the software meets user needs.

---

## Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

### 1. What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering involves crafting precise, effective instructions to optimize responses from AI models.

---

### 2. Example of a Vague vs. Clear Prompt:
- **Vague:** "Tell me about AI."  
- **Clear:** "Explain the key applications of AI in healthcare, focusing on diagnosis and treatment."  
**Why Effective?** It narrows the scope, reducing ambiguity and producing a more relevant response.
